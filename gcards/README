A collection of gcards.

All RGH gcards must use beamline__material_name.txt or GEMC won't recognize W material:
    -Replace <name> with the same name in beamline__geometry_name.txt
    -Examples beamline__geometry_downstreamCone.txt -> beamline__materials_downstreamCone.txt

If using gcard, replace the option in gcard corresponding to beamline. Below is an example line
from ELMO_downstreamCone.gcard:
  - <detector name="/volatile/clas12/zachjj/RGH/Apr2022/DownstreamCone/beamline"     factory="TEXT" variation="DownstreamCone"/>
  - Change the path in detector name from "/volatile/clas12/zachjj/RGH/Apr2022/DownstreamCone/beamline" to new path
  - Change the option variation DownstreamCone to match the name in beamline__geometry_name.gcard

Relevant Gcards and txt files:
1) tr_ELMO.gcard:
  - Used in RGH simulations before any ELMO modifications.
2) ELMO_downstreamCone.gcard coupled with beamline__geometry_downstreamCone.txt:
  - Used in RGH simulations after ELMO was modified completely but before engineering team
    finalized design.
  - Was used to study the background of DC only
3) RGH_FTOF_Cal.gcard coupled with beamline__geometry_downstreamCone.txt:
  - Same as ELMO_downstreamCone.gcard; now includes DC, FTOF, PCAL, and ECAL.
  - CAn be used to analyze all subsystems individually.

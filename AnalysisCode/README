All code is modified from https://github.com/ZacharyMeador/clas12_simulation_rootMacro written by Raffaella De Vita.
The original code does not account for an assymetrical background. This code examines the background of each sector of each
region in the Drift Chamber subsystem of the CLAS12 detector.


Editing dc_occ.C CODE:
----------------------
  - Line 1458: Changes the limit of y-axis on Occupnacy vs. Sector.


Running Code:
-------------
  - Identify what <option> is necessary: dc_occ, moller, ft_rate, htcc_background, or tof_trigger.
  - Copy MakeRootFile and <option> to directory where root files are located.
  - ./MakeRootFile <option>
  - An exectutable will be made to analyze data
  - Run exectutable; ex: ./dc_occ.exe
